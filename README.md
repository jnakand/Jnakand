Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m Juliana and I'm from Brazil ğŸ˜„

I fell in love with data in 2019, and I truly believe in a future guided by it. 

- ğŸ”­ I currently work with data application in the business, statistical analysis on customer profiles, monitoring of business metrics,
creation of new features, creation and monitoring of machine learning models. And I'm always learning everyday.
- ğŸ™Š I speak Portuguese and English.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me by mail at ju.nakandakari@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun Fact: I love to play guitar and piano, dance ballet and I'm also a makeup artist (but I don't makeup the data).
